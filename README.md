It is a website for a school and high school that I am planning to devote my future life if possible. I want to shift the life of young teenager of my country to make their life into fruitful future for themselves and for country. I do not want them to travel away from home become mentally stress, frustrated and waste their teenage in seeking job in dish-washing and cooking. I am not saying its a bad thing but its not choice for everyone and this creates suffocation. In the end it become their life. If you see it from my eye its like a drug to international teenager who dream to be next CEO in GOOGLE or Apple and carry a bag to work for it but end up to catch a knife instead of keyboard just to survive. And his survival never ends because he earns more experience some where else and lack experience completely in a place where he wants to be. Today world has modernized but the ancient problem is still the same. I want it to go obsolete at least I will start from my place. 
Thank you.
